## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Embarking on a PhD is a rigorous academic endeavor. Students are required to deeply engage in specialized fields, collaborating and exchanging insights with global researchers. To excel academically, they continuously delve into, peruse, and dissect numerous scholarly articles. Along this journey, challenges arise, including determining which papers to study, pinpointing their research trajectory, and keeping abreast of groundbreaking studies. While Google Scholar stands as a predominant academic search tool, offering vast scholarly resources, it is not without its limitations.

Recognizing these challenges, I embarked on crafting an innovative academic search engine, harnessing the power of Java and SpringBoot. This engine aspires to bridge the gaps inherent in Google Scholar, delivering more precise and tailored search experiences. Tailored for aspirant PhD candidates unfamiliar with the vast academic landscape or their specific research interests, my platform equips them with features like curated article suggestions, search term enhancements, visual word cloud representations, concise article summaries, and more. To enrich the user experience, functionalities such as liking, saving, and browsing history have been integrated, ensuring users have a comprehensive overview of their academic journey while enabling the system to refine its user-centric recommendations. Beyond facilitating a seamless search experience for students, this initiative opens new horizons and prospects for the broader scholarly domain.
