## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Embarking on a PhD is a rigorous academic endeavor. Students are required to deeply engage in specialized fields, collaborating and exchanging insights with global researchers. To excel academically, they continuously delve into, peruse, and dissect numerous scholarly articles. Along this journey, challenges arise, including determining which papers to study, pinpointing their research trajectory, and keeping abreast of groundbreaking studies. While Google Scholar stands as a predominant academic search tool, offering vast scholarly resources, it is not without its limitations.

Recognizing these challenges, I embarked on crafting an innovative academic search engine, harnessing the power of Java and SpringBoot. This engine aspires to bridge the gaps inherent in Google Scholar, delivering more precise and tailored search experiences. Tailored for aspirant PhD candidates unfamiliar with the vast academic landscape or their specific research interests, my platform equips them with features like curated article suggestions, search term enhancements, visual word cloud representations, concise article summaries, and more. To enrich the user experience, functionalities such as liking, saving, and browsing history have been integrated, ensuring users have a comprehensive overview of their academic journey while enabling the system to refine its user-centric recommendations. Beyond facilitating a seamless search experience for students, this initiative opens new horizons and prospects for the broader scholarly domain.

Utilizing the methodologies and principles acquired during my coursework, I systematically approached the development of this search engine. The foundational knowledge imparted in class became instrumental, offering both a roadmap for the software architecture and insights into user experience design. I diligently applied concepts like data structuring, algorithm optimization, and user-centric design, ensuring that the engine was both efficient and user-friendly.

Furthermore, this project transcended beyond just technical development; it was a deep dive into understanding the intricacies of user behavior and academic research. It pushed me to amalgamate technical skills with a deep sense of empathy for my target audience. Reflecting on this journey, I've come to appreciate the pivotal role that structured learning plays in real-world applications. The marriage of theory and practicality not only results in efficient systems but also ones that truly resonate with users' needs. This venture has solidified my belief in the importance of continuous learning and its tangible impact, propelling me to further harness my academic insights for real-world challenges.

## SECTION 6 : USER GUIDE

`Refer to appendix <Installation & User Guide> in project report at Github Folder: ProjectReport`

### [ 1 ] Setup Instructions

Before you begin, ensure you meet the following requirements:

> Prerequisites:

1. Operating System: macOS (recommended).
2. IDE: IntelliJ IDEA (recommended as it auto-identifies and installs project dependencies).
3. Java: JDK 11.

> Steps:
1. Install IntelliJ IDEA: Download and install from the [official website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac).
2. Install Java JDK 11: Download JDK 11 from the [Oracle official](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) site and follow the on-screen installation instructions.
3. Clone the Repository:
   
```
git clone https://github.com/LuckyBian/ISY5001.git
```

5. Open the cloned repository in IntelliJ IDEA.
6. Wait for the IDE to automatically detect and install all Maven dependencies.

After completing the above steps, your application should be up and running. If you encounter any problems, please double-check that all prerequisites are met.

### [ 2 ] To run the system in other/local machine:
### Install additional necessary libraries. This application works in python 2 only.

> $ sudo apt-get install python-clips clips build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev python-pip

> $ pip install pyclips flask flask-socketio eventlet simplejson pandas
